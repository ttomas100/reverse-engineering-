- html-routes.js here are the routes that check whether user is signed in, whether user already has account and send them to the correct html file.
- package.json: contains all package info, node modules used, version info.
- server.js: requires packages, sets up PORT, creates express and middleware, creates routes and syncs database / logs message in terminal on successful connection to server.
